# My very First Webpage

Welcome!

I am very excited to be sharing my first website

## Overview
This website was created as apart of learning material for the Code Institute's Fullstack Web Developer program.
Please check out my website [here](https://hello-world-gatorwam19.c9users.io/index.html)

## Project Description
I created this site to pull together all of the terminology I've learned this far in HTML fundamentals and CSS fundamentals.
Developing this website has also helped me to become familiar with tools such as:
Cloud9, Git, and GitHub.
The webpage itself contains links to description on each technology used in the program sections.

## Technology
This project was written in HTML and CSS using Cloud9 and is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
